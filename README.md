Analysis of UFO data using JavaScript and HTML

## Overview
In order to get UFO sightings information into a table we used JavaScript to create an html file that will show us the information and through filerts allows us to filter the data by: date, city, state, country, and shape. Along with the filters, formatting and imagery has been added to the html file.

## Results

1. Overview of the HTML file page:
  * Contains various filter boxes on the left side, and the data table on the right.

## Summary
An HTML page has been created using JavaScript code. We used a js file filled with UFO sightings information, and wrote code to create various filters to filter the information. Then, we formatted the information using HTML and CSS. One drawback of this design is that it displays all of the UFO sightings on the page, making it look a bit cluttered and overwhelming. In order to improve this, we could include a button/filter that displays all sightings when clicked. Another improvement could include hiding the comments and adding an expand button - this would reduce the clutter as well and allow the viewer to focus on the data.
